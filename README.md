# Vehicle Counting from Traffic Data Camera
## YOLOv7-DeepSORT Vehicle Detection and Tracking
This repository contains Python code for implementing YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithms in PyTorch. The primary goal of this project is to detect and track vehicles in traffic surveillance video footage, utilizing the YOLO algorithm for detection and the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for tracking.
